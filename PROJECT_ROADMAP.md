# Smart Study Tracker - Project Roadmap

## Project Overview

**Smart Study Tracker** is a Python-based application designed to help students organize, monitor, and improve their study habits. Many students struggle with time management and staying consistent with their study routines. This project provides a simple tool that allows users to log study sessions, track time spent on each subject, and visualize progress through summaries and charts.

Users input what subject they studied, duration, and productivity level. The app generates personalized reports using graphs and summaries, helping identify which subjects need more attention and patterns that affect learning performance.

**Target Audience**: High school and college students, plus self-learners studying online who want to track their effort across different topics.
